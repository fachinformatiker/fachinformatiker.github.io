If I use a GPG key for SSH, you can select a known, good key for me using the GPG web of trust from a public keyserver. This is what <a href="https://monkeysphere.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Monkeysphere Project</a> is working on. Otherwise, nothing you do here affects the web of trust used for GPG encryption and signing.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-gpg-subkey">What is a GPG subkey?</h2><p>A GPG key is actually a collection of keys. There is one primary key, which is typically used only for signing and certification. The suggested usage of GPG is to create a subkey for encryption. This subkey is a separate key that, for all intents and purposes, is signed by your primary key and transmitted at the same time. This practice allows you to revoke the encryption subkey on its own, such as if it becomes compromised, while keeping your primary key valid.</p><p>The important thing to realize is that a GPG key contains multiple keys. For backup and storage purposes, you can operate them as though they are one key, but when it is time to use a key, you can use them independently.</p><p>This exercise will use a subkey that has been created for authentication to complete SSH connections. This authentication subkey will completely replace the keypair you may have generated in the past with <strong>ssh key-gen</strong>. You can create as many of these as you want if you need multiple SSH keys.</p><h2 id="create-an-authentication-subkey">Create an authentication subkey</h2><p>You should already have a GPG key. If you don't, read one of the many <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/create-gpg-keys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fine tutorials</a> available on this topic. You will create the subkey by editing your existing key. You need to edit your key in expert mode to get access to the appropriate options.</p><p>The workflow adds a new key where you can choose its capabilities—specifically, you want to toggle its capabilities to just have authentication. SSH typically uses a 2048-bit RSA key that does not expire (type 8 in the options below).</p><p>Below is an edited version of the workflow. This and all other commands were tested on Fedora 29.</p><div class="geshifilter"><blockquote><div class="text geshifilter-text">$ gpg2 --expert --edit-key &lt;KEY ID&gt;<br>gpg&gt; addkey<br>Please select what kind of key you want:<br>(3) DSA (sign only)<br>(4) RSA (sign only)<br>(5) Elgamal (encrypt only)<br>(6) RSA (encrypt only)<br>(7) DSA (set your own capabilities)<br>(8) RSA (set your own capabilities)<br>(10) ECC (sign only)<br>(11) ECC (set your own capabilities)<br>(12) ECC (encrypt only)<br>(13) Existing key<br>Your selection? 8Possible actions for a RSA key: Sign Encrypt Authenticate<br>Current allowed actions: Sign Encrypt<p></p><p>(S) Toggle the sign capability<br>(E) Toggle the encrypt capability<br>(A) Toggle the authenticate capability<br>(Q) Finished</p><p>Your selection? s<br>Your selection? e<br>Your selection? a</p><p>Possible actions for a RSA key: Sign Encrypt Authenticate<br>Current allowed actions: Authenticate</p><p>(S) Toggle the sign capability<br>(E) Toggle the encrypt capability<br>(A) Toggle the authenticate capability<br>(Q) Finished</p><p>Your selection? q<br>RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.<br>What keysize do you want?

To use a GPG key, you'll use a similar program, <strong>gpg-agent</strong>, that manages GPG keys. To get <strong>gpg-agent</strong> to handle requests from SSH, you need to enable support by adding the line <strong>enable-ssh-support</strong> to the <strong>~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</strong>.</p><div class="geshifilter"><blockquote><div class="text geshifilter-text">$ cat .gnupg/gpg-agent.conf<br>enable-ssh-support</div></blockquote></div><p>Optionally, you may want to pre-specify the keys to be used for SSH so you won't have to use <strong>ssh-add</strong> to load the keys. To do this, specify the keys in the <strong>~/.gnupg/sshcontrol</strong> file. The entries in this file are <em>keygrips</em>—internal identifiers <strong>gpg-agent</strong> uses to refer to keys. Unlike a key hash, a keygrip refers to both the public and private key. To find the keygrip, use <strong>gpg2 -K --with-keygrip</strong>, as shown below. Then add that line to the <strong>sshcontrol</strong> file.</p><div class="geshifilter"><blockquote><div class="text geshifilter-text">$ gpg2 -K --with-keygrip<br>/home/bexelbie/.gnupg/pubring.kbx<br>------------------------------<br>sec   rsa2048 2019-03-21 [SC] [expires: 2021-03-20]<br>96F33EA7F4E0F7051D75FC208715AF32191DB135<br>Keygrip = 90E08830BC1AAD225E657AD4FBE638B3D8E50C9E<br>uid           [ultimate] Brian Exelbierd<br>ssb   rsa2048 2019-03-21 [E] [expires: 2021-03-20]<br>Keygrip = 5FA04ABEBFBC5089E50EDEB43198B4895BCA2136<br>ssb   rsa2048 2019-03-21 [A]<br>Keygrip = 7710BA0643CC022B92544181FF2EAC2A290CDC0E$ echo 7710BA0643CC022B92544181FF2EAC2A290CDC0E &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol<p></p></div></blockquote></div><p>Last, you need to tell SSH how to access the <strong>gpg-agent</strong>. This is done by changing the value of the <strong>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</strong> environment variable. The following two lines, when added to your <strong>~/.bashrc</strong>, will ensure the variable is set correctly and that the agent is lau</p><p>nched and ready for use.</p><div class="geshifilter"><blockquote><div class="text geshifilter-text">$ cat ~/.bashrc<br>...<br>export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)<br>gpgconf --launch gpg-agent<br>...</div></blockquote></div><p>To continue, execute those commands in your current session.</p><h2 id="share-your-ssh-key">Share your SSH key</h2><p>In order to use SSH, you need to share your public key with the remote host. You have two options. First, you can run <strong>ssh-add -L</strong> to list your public keys and copy it manually to the remote host. You can also use <strong>ssh-copy-id</strong>. From this perspective, nothing has changed.</p><h2 id="congratulations">Congratulations!</h2><p>You have now enabled SSH access using a GPG key for authentication! SSH will continue to work as expected, and the machines you are connecting to won't need any configuration changes. You've reduced the number of key files you need to manage and securely back up while simultaneously enabling the opportunity to take part in different forms of key distribution. Stay safe and practice good key hygiene!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 12, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/homelab/">Homelab</a></li><li><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/linux/">Linux</a></li><li><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/networking/">Networking</a></li><li><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/security/">Security</a></li><li><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/server/">Server</a></li><li><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/tutorials/">Tutorials</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/authors/patrick-szalewicz/" class="invert" rel="author">Patrick Szalewicz</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/ssh-tunnelling-for-fun-and-profit-autossh.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> SSH tunnelling for fun and profit: Autossh</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/intrusion-detection-with-git-the-basics.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Intrusion detection with git – the basics </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-07-11T21:02" class="feed__date">July 11, 2019</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/proxy-using-ssh-tunnel.html" class="invert">Proxy Using SSH Tunnel</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-07-11T20:53" class="feed__date">July 11, 2019</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-rtmp-server-using-nginx.html" class="invert">How to set up your own private RTMP server using nginx</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://fachinformatiker.github.io/fachinformatiker.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
